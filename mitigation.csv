Atlantic salmon,Atlantic_salmon,"The risk for AIS/FFHPP/SARP is considered low with high certainty (check with SAR). However, precautions should be taken to ensure no escapes or accidental introductions occur. It is recommended that all equipment used to capture, rear, hold, or transport the species  (and associated water used in transfer) should be cleaned, drained, dried, and decontaminated prior to use elsewhere. Approval of introduction & transfer requests do not preclude individuals from their responsibilities to ensure no introductions of non-indigenous species (including species that are common to Nova Scotia but from a different genetic strain) to areas they are not indigenous to as states under the Aquatic Invasive Species Regulations s. 10.

Rainbow trout,Rainbow_trout,"The risk for AIS/FFHPP/SARP is considered low with high certainty since these activities have historically been carried out in this waterbody. However, I do note that Rainbow trout are not native to NS and that the assessed risk level is contingent on the routine nature of these activities and extreme care should be taken to prevent escapees. Pursuant to s.10 of the Aquatic Invasive Species Regulations: ""It is prohibited for any person to introduce an aquatic species into a particular region or body of water frequented by fish where it is not indigenous unless authorized to do so under federal or provincial law."" Furthermore, this I&T permit would not constitute authorization to introduce an aquatic species into a particular region or body of water. However, precautions should be taken to ensure no escapes or accidental introductions occur. It is recommended that all equipment used to capture, rear, hold, or transport the species  (and associated water used in transfer) should be cleaned, drained, dried, and decontaminated prior to use elsewhere.
