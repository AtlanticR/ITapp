# Introductions and Transfers Tool

This tool is designed to facilitate the process of reviewing applications for introductions and transfers of aquaculture stock. 

Currently, the app is only operational for native shellfish transfers in the Maritimes region. Users must have access to DFO Maritimes shared `W` drive for access to the monitoring date.

# Installation

- Users must first install R (from the Software Center)
- [Download](https://github.com/remi-daigle/ITapp/archive/master.zip) and unzip this repository
- Double click on the `ITapp.bat`

The first time you run it, it will take a **very** long time to install, but this is a one time thing. This is necessary to avoid including sensitive data in this repository. Feel free to create a shortcut to the `ITapp.bat`file on your desktop.
